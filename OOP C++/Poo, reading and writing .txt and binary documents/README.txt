=> Exercise 1 :

        Make the class Vector containing two fields: x of type double and
        y of dual type.
        This class contains a parameterless constructor and another with parameter
        to your imagination. Realize the overloading of the display operator and the equality operator.
        Make the public derived Vector3D subclass of Vector. She has a
        additional field z (double). Write a single constructor to your imagination.



=> Exercise 2


Write declarations for a list of Car objects.
The private fields of a car are: model, make and type (petrol, hybrid or electric).

Suppose we have such a list in memory.
You can add 6 cars to your list, two of each type.

       Write functions and their calls for:
 
	1. Display all cars;
	2. Show first and last car.
	3. Display cars according to their types.
	4. Show cars according to their models.



=> Exercise 3

Write a method and its call to create a text file of the integers between 1 and 100 which are multiples of 3 whose name is "Multip3.text".

Write a function and its calls to read the text file "text3.txt" and
to display:
	a) the multiples of 9 found in this file.
	b) the multiples of 6 found in this file.
