Situation

Create a Java application that manages mixed teams formed for a given game.
The game is made for teams of two members.
Members must be registered with the league of the game.
Each member is described by name and gender (M for male and F for female).
The two members of a team must be of opposite sexes.
During a competition, each team is entitled to a maximum of two replacements of its members.
The replacement of a member must be made by a member of the same sex.

Programming

1. Create a Member class that allows you to create members affiliated with the league of the game in question. Each member being described by name and gender
   To. Create an initializer constructor for the class
	i. Provide an UnknownSexException exception class;
	ii. The constructor must raise the UnknownSexException exception if the gender is different from M or F.
	b. Add the methods getters, equals.

2. Create a TestMember test class for the Member class.
   To. Include 3 relevant tests without exception for the manufacturer.
	b. Include constructor test with exception

3. Create a Team class that lets you create two-member teams for competition.
   To. Create an initializer constructor for the class.
	i. Provide a NonCompliantTeamException exception class;
	ii. The constructor must throw the NonConformingTeamException exception if the two members are of the same gender.
	b. Add getters and setters.

4. Create a TestTeam test class for the Team class.
   To. Include a builder's test without exception.
	b. Include a constructor test with exception.

5. Add in the EquipeTest class, two tests for a method that will be added
   to the Team class. This method will be used to replace a team member with a
   other member. It could have the following form: replaceMember(member
   outgoing, returning member)
   To. The first test should have no exceptions.
	b. The second test should allow for an exception:
	NonCompliantReplacementException. This exception must be thrown by
	The replaceMember(â€¦) method if the outgoing member and the
	returning member are not of the same sex, or if the outgoing member and the
	returning are the same, or if the outgoing member is not a member of
	the team.
